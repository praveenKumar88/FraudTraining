Metrics in fraud detection are:
	•	Precision: How many of the flagged transactions are actually fraudulent?
	•	Recall: How many fraudulent transactions did this model correctly identify out of the total fraudulent ones?
	•	F1 Score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  •	ROC-AUC: The area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic.

Initially, we’ll start with a Random Forest model since its simple to detect fraud based on transaction attributes.
